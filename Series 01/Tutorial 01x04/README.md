## Operating system support

The executables compiled in the previous lesson can be run from other computers
 with the same operating system but without any Rust installed. However, there
 are some limitations.

### Windows

The `hello.exe` compiled in the previous lesson will work across all Windows.

### Linux

The `hello` binary compiled in the previous lesson will generally only work
 across the same Linux distruibution as the one in which it was created.

### macOS

I don't have experience with macOS, but the same as with Linux should apply.

## Copy the executable file

1. Copy the executable file generated in the previous lesson
2. Run it as in the previous lesson
