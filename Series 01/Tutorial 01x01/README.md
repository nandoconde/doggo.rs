## Motivation

- No previous programming language required
- Only need a computer and Internet connection
- For all operative systems:
  - Windows
  - macOS
  - Linux
- Free!

## Programming languages

- Languages used to communicate with machines.
- Some simmilarities with human languages:
  - Syntax
  - Vocabulary
  - Meaning
- Some differences:
  - Strict order of sentences
- Programming language levels
  - High level: closer to human language
    - JavaScript
    - Python
    - Julia
  - Low level: closer to computer language
    - C
    - C++
    - Fortran
- Safe programming languages
  - Unsafe: allow access to computer capabilities without checking if the commands are harmful for memory
  - Safe: only allows access to computer capabilities after checking if the commands are harmful

## Why Rust?

- Middle ground between high- and low-level programming languages
  - Allows the freedom of high-level languages
  - Allows the control over the machine of low-level languages
- Fast and safe
  - Allows direct access to comptuer resources in a safe way
  - Disallows compilation of unsafe programs -> they are not even created
- Slow learning curve
- Fast fixing times
- Compiled: creates executables
- Portable executables
