## Variables in programming

- Variables in coding are different to mathematical variables.
- They may be constant or mutable.
- Constant: their value remains constant during the execution of the program.
- Mutable: their value may change during the execution of the program.
- If the value changes after it has been used to produce intermediate results, those results are
   not updated automatically.
- Declaration: naming and using a variable for the first time.
- Assignment: giving a value to a variable.
- Mutation: changing the value of a variable.

## Variables in Rust

- Constants: `let`
- Typed constants: `const`
- Mutable: `let mut`
- Assignment: `=`
- Increment by: `+=`
- Decrement by: `-=`
- Naming variables: when possible, use descriptive lowercase names.
- Naming constants: when possible, use descriptive uppercase names.
